### 19 December
- Disallowed bots used to collect content to train LLMs on from crawling this website by adding this information to the robots.txt file. I'm aware that this is not really the best solution to this particular issue, that some players in the AI space blankly ignore the robots.txt file, but it's what we have so far.
- The changelog was getting a bit long, so I cut it into pieces (one changelog per month), and created a collection to group them together on an overview page, which on top of a list of all changelogs also has the latest changelog's content in full.

### 18 December 2024
- You can't find this website on Google. So I set up some SEO stuff in the config file, verified my ownership of the domain on Google Search Console, and added a sitemap and a robots.txt file, in an effort to hopefully change that.

### 12 December 2024
- More fun with colours.
- More importantly, now that I have my first post with a footnote, I've added a sort-of heading to the footnotes section, though I could only do that by using a pseudo-element. Not as clean a solution as I would like, but I'm not versed in JavaScript anywhere near well enough to write a script myself to get it exactly where I want it. You live, you learn.

### 11 December 2024
- Fun with colours and fonts. At some point I'm going to find a combination that will satisfy me long-time.

### 6 December 2024
- Fun with colours! Changed the background colour (excluding header and footer), font colour, link colour, and the colours for the borders between the introductory text/tag section and the main body of text. Also switched the colour of the RSS symbol in the lower left corner from orange to an unobtrusive gray. This had been bothering me since day one.
- I didn't like how much vertical space the footer was using, so I rearranged things in there a bit to make it smaller. I don't think I'm quite finished with it _yet_, but good enough for now.

### 5 December 2024
- Replaced the tag buttons with a tag list. It's cleaner and simpler.
- Defined a separate style for the piece of introductory text I add to posts that are part of a series. This allowed me to get rid of horizontal rules completely.

### 4 December 2024
- Added the Now page.
- Style template I used for this website had the title of the pages that the navbar has links to set up as the name for the links themselves. I did not like that, so I figured out a system to separate page title from link name.
- Fun with fonts! Read up on web fonts, at least until I knew enough to implement them on this website. Now using Source Serif 4 for headings.
- Using horizontal rules in some places, really just as placeholders while I develop this website's layout and styling, and they do not look good. Replaced them now in one place where I was using them, at the top of the tag section on blog posts. A simple 1px solid border already looks much nicer.

### 1 December 2024
- Made the header sticky and non-transparent.
