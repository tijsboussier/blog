### 30 November 2024
- Set up a local test environment for this website, so I won't have to run tests in production anymore.

### 29 November 2024
- Added an icon for [The Storygraph](https://www.thestorygraph.com/) in the footer. The Storygraph is not part of the standard set of platforms Minima has a social media icon for, so I converted the service's logo into an SVG file, edited it to make sure it had the right size and color to fit the rest of the icons, then implemented it.

### 28 November 2024
- Set up a basic tagging system.
- Figured out how to change the theme's SASS variables and added custom styles to get font-family, font-weight and text-align where I wanted them to be.
- Created this changelog.

### 27 November 2024
- Launched the website. In truth it had already been live for a few days for testing purposes (I did not have a local test environment set up yet), but on 27 November I published my first post and shared that news on Instagram.
