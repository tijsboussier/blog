Gone are the days when fanfiction, its writers and its readers, were treated as little more than the butt of jokes whenever mainstream media covered them. Today, fanfiction is sparking the interest of a whole host of parties instead: grifters selling illegal prints or audiobook versions of popular works of fanfiction, tech companies vacuuming up whole fanfic archives to fill datasets to train their LLMs on with, as well as a readership that's swelling faster than it ever has before, with new readers, unaware of the fanfic community's customs and habits, bringing with them changes in the way fanfic writers and readers relate to and behave around each other. Elizabeth Minkel discusses each of these trends, as well as the discomfort, friction and division this has wrought within the fanfiction community. 

What does all of this mean for the future of fanfiction and the tightly-knit community that traditionally sustained it? Minkel has no clear-cut answer to that question, but maybe there's some hope to be found in the community ties that bind.
