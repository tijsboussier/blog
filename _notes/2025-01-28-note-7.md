_Emilia Pérez_ already won four Golden Globes as well as a European Film Award, and it's now up for no less than fourteen Academy Awards. Like, what? No seriously, _what_? This doesn't make any sense to me. Has the movie business establishment lost their collective marbles? All that glitters is not gold!  

If the movie stands out in any way - and I don't think it's very memorable at all - it is purely for its faults, which are many. I personally found it clunky, melodramatic and offensive, and its music (_Emilia Pérez_ is a musical, so this is particularly relevant) completely unremarkable, boring, and badly sung. This was my opinion even before I found out the film, which is mainly set in Mexico, was filmed entirely in France, or that it does not feature even one Mexican actor in any of its main roles, which honestly are even better reasons to dunk on it.  

This article by Jack Hamilton shows I'm not alone here. He really goes off and tears _Emilia Pérez_ a new one. If this movie deserves any attention - and honestly, no, it doesn't - it's this kind.
