_Emilia Pérez_ already won four Golden Globes as well as a European Film Award and it's now up for no less than fourteen Academy Awards. Like, what? No seriously, _what_? This doesn't make any sense. Has the movie business establishment lost their collective marbles?  

If the movie stands out in any way - and I don't think it's very memorable at all - it is purely for its faults, which are many. I personally found it clunky and melodramatic, its depiction of gender transition  offensive, its music (_Emilia Pérez_ is a musical, so this is particularly relevant) completely unremarkable, boring, and performed badly. This was my opinion even before I found out the film, which is mainly set in Mexico, was filmed almost entirely in France, or that it does not feature even one Mexican actor in any of its main roles.

Putting it plain and simple, there's no shortage of reasons to dunk on this movie. Which is exactly what Jack Hamilton does in his article for *Slate*. He really goes off and tears _Emilia Pérez_ a new one, and I feel seen.
