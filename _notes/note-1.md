## <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/sulking-is-a-fascinating-form-of-indirect-communication" target="_blank">The Joy of Sulk</a> by Rebecca Roache

I've been known to sulk once or twice in my life, so I think it's fair to say I have a good intuition of what a sulk is. I know one when I see one, basically. If you'd ask me to describe what it is, though, I'd be in trouble.

Luckily, I don't have to. In her essay "The Joy of Sulk", Rebecca Roache puts the act of sulking front and center and tries to define what it is, exactly, what it communicates, and how it achieves this. This exercise leads her to consider how sulking is both similar to and yet different from other forms of indirect communication, as well as why we do it in the first place, when openness and transparency about how we're feeling is just as available an option and a much better one at that. (Or is it?)

I never imagined sulking could be such an interesting topic, but Roache proves it can be. On top of this, the article is also just really fun to read.
