In the aftermath of last year's US presidential elections, amid uncertainty and fear around what Trump's presidency has in store for us in the months and years ahead, Julie Philips looks towards Ursula K. Le Guin for inspiration on how to resist without buckling under the pressure.  

After re-reading an essay that Ursula K. Le Guin wrote shortly after Trump's first presidential election win in 2016, Philips dives into the author's life beyond her illustrious writing career, as a political activist on the local and (sometimes) national level, and shows how the writer fought for and defended the issues, ideas and values she believed in on her own terms, not by engaging the ones she opposed directly all that often, but instead by holding steady, staying her ground, patiently performing the often menial labour of grassroots activism.  

I don't know if this will be enough, if it's the way to beat Trump, to beat the current pull to the far right in politics pretty much the world over, but whenever resilience runs low - as it certainly will in certain moments - I do think Le Guin's approach can be a guiding light.  

I've long admired Le Guin's incredibly well-constructed, well-considered, poignant and clear narratives, the sociological and anthropological thought experiments that lay at the basis of them, the complicated and engaging characters that populate them and the beautiful sentences she devised to tell them. There really is no one quite like her. It's no surprise she considered the real world, its politics and her own role in it with just as much thoughtfulness as she did her fictional imaginations. It only makes me admire her more.
