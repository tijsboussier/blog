Mike Masnick's analysis of Meta's new content moderation policies points out both the parts of it that make sense, and the parts of it that are just bad or stupid. I haven't made up my mind if I agree with everything it says, but it's nice to get a different, more nuanced take on it than I've seen in general.

One thing I for sure am taking from it, though, is the following quote:

> Of course, bad faith actors, particularly on the right, have long tried to paint fact-checking as “censorship.” But this talking point [...] is utter nonsense. Fact-checking is the epitome of “more speech”— exactly what the marketplace of ideas demands. By caving to those who want to silence fact-checkers, Meta is revealing how hollow its free speech rhetoric really is.

Fact-checking as an *expansion* of speech, rather than a limitation on the speech it's written in reaction to, is a new idea to me, but it makes complete sense. The fact that the word *censorship* is put in quotation marks here is very relevant, too, and brings me to a particular pet peeve of mine. Using terms like 'free speech' and 'censorship' to talk about what privately run platforms allow or disallow you to say on them doesn't make much sense and reveals a big misunderstanding of what 'free speech' and 'censorship' actually are. So once more, for the people in the back: they're about what restrictions *governments* can put on their citizens'/institutions'/corporations' speech, stupid!
