<p class="infobox">2024 was a good reading year. I read 27 books and counting, which is more than I achieved in quite a number of years. Now ranking books is a fool's errand and I'm not even going to try. That said, there are books that struck a chord with me more than others, mostly in good ways, some in bad. For the next few weeks, as a way to kick-start this spanking new blog, I've chosen to highlight a few of them. This is my 2024: A Reading Year in Review series.</p>

*A Canticle for Leibowitz* is the only novel by Walter M. Miller Jr. published during his lifetime.[^1] Mainly a short story and TV writer, Miller assembled the novel from three novelettes he had written for *The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction* between 1955 and 1957, though he made significant edits to them for the 1959 book version. The novel went on to win him a Hugo Award, but the critical acclaim did not inspire him to write more. After *Canticle* he stopped publishing altogether, hardly to be seen or heard from again.

It's tempting to read this as the lifestory of a singular and mysterious genius. I only mention it as a way to explain why I remained completely ignorant of this book for as long as I did. With *Canticle* Miller proved himself to be a terrific writer, but with so few works to his name he's not mentioned on many Science Fiction's Greatest Authors lists. The book itself became a touchstone for fans of post-apocalyptic literature, however, and it's through this status as a masterpiece of the genre that it found its way to me eventually. I'm really happy it did.

On the face of it, *A Canticle for Leibowitz*'s plot might not sound terribly original. It's certainly true that, while Miller was still among the early authors to shape society's fears of nuclear war, nuclear holocaust and the genetic effects of nuclear fallout into literary fiction, he was by no means the first. These themes became a fixture of post-apocalyptic fiction in the aftermath of World War II and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

Similarly, an institution that through the preservation of past knowledge helps guide humanity through a calamity, possibly shortening its effects, is a well-established trope in speculative fiction, too. Isaac Asimov published the first of the short stories that would grow into his *Foundation* series, by far the most famous example of this trope, in 1942, a full decade before Miller started working on even the earliest versions of what would become *Canticle*.

Tropes are not the issue, however. It's what a piece of fiction does with them that counts. *A Canticle for Leibowitz*'s basic components may have a familiar ring to them, but it combines and transforms them in ways that makes it entirely distinct.

## Light in a world undone

A nuclear war has wiped out much of the world's population, as well as most of its infrastructure. Many of the cataclysm's survivors put the blame for it on science, advanced technology and ultimately learning itself. After all, it's scientists and engineers who developed the weapons that made world-wide annihilation a possibility in the first place. This anti-intellectual sentiment quickly grows virulent: books and documents are destroyed by the truckloads, scholars are lynched by the thousands and soon simply knowing how to read becomes suspicious. Humanity is left largely illiterate, and bereft of the knowledge it built over millennia. 

A former U.S. military engineer, Isaac Edward Leibowitz, manages to escape the anti-intellectual mobs. He finds refuge in a Cistercian monastery, where after taking the religious vows and embracing monastic life he dedicates himself to the collection, safeguarding and preservation of the few extant physical traces of twentieth-century knowledge. He eventually secures the Catholic Church's permission to found his own monastic order, singularly devoted to this purpose. Leibowitz's salvation proves short-lived; he is betrayed and killed, but the Order he founded and the Memorabilia, as the collection of books and documents he left it are referred to, are safe.

This is the backstory. The book's events actually start 600 years later, in the American Midwestern desert where the Albertian Order of Leibowitz is located. In three stories, each set 600 years apart, we find out how the  Order tries to stay the course as the world around it changes. In each one it is faced with a crisis stemming from the strain between the purpose it was created for several centuries ago, and the power struggles in the society it finds itself in now.

## Rinse, repeat

The three stories are temporary stops in a timeline that looks suspiciously familiar. We hop from a new Dark Age in "Fiat Homo", make a pitstop at a new Renaissance in "Fiat Lux", to finally arrive at a new Modern Age (complete with an encore of the Cold War) in "Fiat Voluntas Tua". To finish things off we get another nuclear holocaust. Clearly, in Miller's view of things, events like World War II, like Hiroshima and Nagasaki, are not aberrations. They can and will happen again. The particulars change, but in the end it's variations on a theme.

It's not for lack of trying, at least on the monks' part. Their efforts to protect and unravel the knowledge that is locked up in the Memorabilia, knowledge that is already ancient by the time we first check in with them, are noble. And to their credit, the Order - and the Catholic Church with it - really try to write a different future for humanity. They succeed in preserving the Memorabilia for close to two millennia after Leibowitz left them in their care, no small feat in and of itself. All too conscious of where it might lead, they attempt to prevent either the Memorabilia or themselves to be used as assets or pawns in the games of the political powers surrounding them, but still share the knowledge in them when asked, when it's for the benefit of humanity.

In the end it's hardly relevant, however. The monks are capable archivists, but essentially clueless: largely clueless about the knowledge in the Memorabilia, to hilarious effect, and clueless about how to use it in a way that will not ultimately lead to world-spanning disaster. They doubt, they dally, they argue, meanwhile the world around them collects the knowledge, develops the science and builds the machines that will be its doom all over again all on its own, the Memorabilia reduced to nothing more than a footnote in history.

When nuclear holocaust strikes a second time at the end of "Fiat Voluntas Tua", the story comes full circle. Humankind ends up making the same mistakes. There's a strong assumption here that human knowledge, science and technology left unchecked will inevitably lead to this outcome, that humanity is predisposed to turn them into mere tools to employ in battles for power and control, or failing those, to bring about mutually assured destruction. Our instrumentalisation and weaponisation of knowledge is all but assured. The Albertian Order of Leibowitz never stood a chance.

## Who knew monks could be this fun?

The majority of the book is told through the eyes of order members. What we know about what's going on outside of the abbey's walls we learn mostly second-hand, and their viewpoint is distinct, not only from the one held by the society they move around in, but also from the reader's own. Their obliviousness, their failure to adapt to changing times, to redress society's shortcomings, often lead to hilarious results. Really, these monks are side-splittingly funny. 

In "Fiat Homo", Brother Francis singularly devotes himself for more than a *decade* to making an expensive illumination of a document which he understands nothing of. It's not important work by a long shot, and his self-serious justifications for this task he set himself are hysterical. And that's just one example; Dom Zerchi's struggles with his transcription and universal translator machine in "Fiat Voluntas Tua" is just as gratifying. Miller uses dry wit and ironic distance liberally, and he is a master of both. 

Don't get me wrong though, the monks are not just there as laughing stocks. They are shown in a sympathetic light. Their hearts are in the right place, their intentions are good, and they are intelligent. Their insistence to look at things from all angles, to ponder any question put before them thoroughly, to also consider the ethical (and religious) dimensions or repercussions, is a virtue, but it requires a slowness and deliberateness of decision-making that the world around them is not willing or able to comply to. As readers we want them to succeed, we root for them. Which makes the book's ending hit that much harder.

Perhaps - and I don't want to get into this too much, I need to think on this further, but it is a question I have - the book is *also* suggesting a religious institution is not the best steward for the fruits of humanity's knowledge, either. Religion looms large in the novel, and I'm not sure it's always in a good way. The final story in particular has the abbot make some calls that clearly sprout from his religious convictions and it feels uncomfortable. I think that's intentional. At the very least, things are not as simple as: monks good, world bad.

*Canticle*'s humour is an essential part of its DNA and really pushes it beyond where post-apocalyptic fiction usually goes. It's definitely a major reason why I fell in love with the book. But no matter how much fun these monks are to hang around, their ultimate failure at preventing much of anything, really, is more than a little tragic.

## When at first you don't succeed

Since they first appeared in the 1950s, postnuclear warscapes in fiction have never really gone away. You can easily find them not just in literature, but also in film, TV and video games. In such a crowded field, *A Canticle for Leibowitz* is something special. The book works within a familiar framework, but it uses it as an entryway into a much more profound contemplation on humankind's relation to the body of knowledge it accrues, and its deadpan humour and colourful characters give you plenty to enjoy regardless of whether you agree with its central premise. 

I'm barely scratching the surface here, too. I have not gone into the book's approach to Catholic religion, or its use of the motif of the Wandering Jew, both interesting topics of discussion in their own right. There's a lot to chew on. Though I have only read it the once, I feel confident *Canticle* is the kind of book that reveals more as you reread it.

Humanity's quest for knowledge is often considered and presented as one of its finest, most noble traits. If you take Miller's word for it, however, it will not save us. Humankind's instrumentalisation and weaponisation of knowledge is all but assured and the question is not *whether* but *when* it will repeat the mistakes of the past. I wish I was more hopeful myself, but in the strange and worrying times we find ourselves in I'm not sure that I am.

Still, it's important to at least try. When anti-intellectual sentiment is so widespread, academics and journalists so distrusted, disinormation thrown around by world leaders with reckless abandon, the pursuit and dissemination of real, verified knowledge and truth are vital. That pursuit is not innocent either. Like any human endeavour it is fallible, imperfect, lacking; the knowledge gained from it shouldn't be taken as gospel. But when it is engaged with fairly, responsibly, ethically, it can be a counterweight. It is under threat right now. We can't give up on it.

That seems to be where Miller finishes things off, too. In the book's final chapters, the Memorabilia get sent to one of Earth's extrasolar colonies while Earth burns. Humankind will try to get it right, again. Sure, it might just end up being another spin of the wheel, but who knows, maybe - *maybe* - this time will be different.

[^1]: A second novel, *Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman*, set in the same world as *Canticle* and with a story running parallel to some of that earlier book's events, was published posthumously. Miller also didn't finish it himself, but left that up to Terry Bisson.
