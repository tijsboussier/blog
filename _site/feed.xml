<p><strong>2024 was a good reading year. I read 27 books and counting, which is more than I achieved in quite a number of years. Now ranking books is a fool’s errand and I’m not even going to try. That said, there are books that struck a chord with me more than others, mostly in good ways, some in bad. For the next few weeks, as a way to kick-start this spanking new blog, I’ve chosen to highlight a few of them. This is my 2024: A Reading Year in Review series.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>As I was making my way through <em>The Ten Thousand Doors of January</em> by Alix E. Harrow recently, I couldn’t help but be reminded of <em>Babel, or the Necessity of Violence</em> by R.F. Kuang, which I’d read a few months prior. This makes sense, I feel; the two bear some striking similarities. But there’s also plenty that makes them stand out on their own, as works of truly creative and thoughtful speculative fiction.</p>

<p><strong>Beware, There Be Spoilers! While I’ve shied away from giving absolutely everything away, in what follows I do go into the central premises of the books quite a bit.</strong></p>

<p>Both novels are alternate histories. While <em>Babel</em> is set in the 1830s and the events in <em>Doors</em> take place in the 1900s, this situates both books’ stories in the age when the western colonial empires were at their strongest. Neither of the books’ protagonists is white - <em>Babel</em>’s Robin is Cantonese, <em>Doors</em>’ January is described as red-skinned - and this is relevant to the story; Robin and January are living in societies where whiteness is the norm and racism is a major theme in both books. Furthermore, both characters are taken under the wing of powerful men at a young age and groomed to follow in their guardians’ footsteps. Both will have to come to terms with that upbringing and education. What was it all for, and can they continue to conform to it? And if not, then what could escape possibly look like?</p>

<p>The issue at the core of both novels is one and the same: they both attempt to dissect the diabolical confluence of colonialism, imperialism, capitalism, racism and classism that we call Empire, and all it entails. In both cases Empire’s observed through the eyes of a character who if not for the intervention of their benefactors would have been at the receiving end of its worst crimes, and their experiences as wards of powerful agents of Empire, this position ‘in-between’ where they can enjoy some of its comforts while still exposed to its prejudices, discrimination, racism and violence, will have a major impact on the people they will become and the choices they will make.</p>

<p>In the last few years the conversation about a more thorough dismantling of colonial structures and legacies than was achieved through the decolonisation process of the twentieth century, of which the decolonisation of public spaces and university curricula is only a part, has, however haltingly, become part of the political and public discourse. It is then of course no surprise to also find fiction that engages with it; that’s par for the course. Both <em>Babel</em> and <em>The Ten Thousand Doors of January</em> were published fairly recently (<em>Doors</em> in 2019, <em>Babel</em> in 2022), right as these debates were gaining more and more traction. It is also only to be expected - and <em>right</em> - that an attempt is made in this kind of fiction to tell stories through the eyes of the colonised rather than the colonisers. If on top of all of that you <em>also</em> want your characters to try and take apart this system from within, whether literally or metaphorically, then you <em>would</em> need your main character to be somehow on the inside of it. Looking at it from this light, the similarities between <em>Babel</em> and <em>The Ten Thousand Doors of January</em> perhaps don’t look all that surprising anymore.</p>

<p>Then again it doesn’t truly matter. The similarities are interesting to consider, sure, but if they tell us anything more I guess it’s that there’s more space now to tell stories like these, from these perspectives, than there perhaps ever was in the past. That’s a cause for celebration. Besides, for all these two books have in common there’s still plenty that makes them unique, too. They carve similar paths, even arrive at somewhat similar destinations, and yet I couldn’t tell you which one did it better; they are still entirely their own thing. Time to sing their individual praises.</p>

<h2 id="rf-kuangs-babel-or-the-necessity-of-violence">R.F. Kuang’s <em>Babel, or the Necessity of Violence</em></h2>

<p><img src="/docs/assets/images/babel.jpg" style="height: 300px; vertical-align: top; margin: 0.3em 1em 1em 0; float: left;" /></p>

<p><em>Babel</em> is set in 1830s England, with most of the events taking place in Oxford. England rules a global empire that is just as big and dominant as it was in the real world, but with one important difference: in this version of history England’s supremacy depends on its mastery and control of the latent magic in silver bars. Silver bars, when inscribed with two words from separate languages with similar but not identical meanings (referred to in-world as a match-pair), draw power from the space between these words, from what is lost in translation, and express it, giving their wielder the ability to manipulate reality. England applies this magic to improve agricultural yields, increase industrial production, or make carriages run more smoothly, as well as for more nefarious means.</p>

<p>In order to ensure its control over its territories and their populations, colonial ánd domestic, England needs to prevent - or, failing that, severly hamper - the use of this kind of magic by other actors. It therefore finds itself in a constant struggle to maintain its all-but monopoly on the two resources required for it to work: silver, and the science of comparative linguistics. There’s a problem, however, in that a lot of its match-pairs are losing their potency. As languages meet, intermingle and become more similar, which in an age of globalisation and empire is all but assured, the space between the analogous but not fully interchangeable words it was relying on is shrinking, and with it the power that can be extracted from it.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, Oxford University’s Royal Institute of Translation (nicknamed ‘Babel’), preeminent place of study for match-pairs and silver bar magic, is turning to languages that have had less exposure to, and thus exchange with, European ones. In the languages spoken by the native populations of its colonies and client states England has a ready supply of these, but a firm grasp of the languages used to create match-pairs with is paramount for the magic derived from them to have the desired strength and efficacy. It is for this reason, and this reason <em>alone</em>, that Robin and his friends are offered the chance to study at the Institute. As native speakers of languages that fit the requirements, they are uniquely qualified to come up with new and powerful match-pairs that will assure England’s continued supremacy on the world stage.</p>

<p>If, like me, you’re fascinated by languages and linguistics, this book is a delight. I mean, not only are comparative linguistics and etymology the only known entryway to magic, which is such a fun idea in and of itself, but also, <em>language convergence is its enemy</em>? Was this book written <em>just</em> for me? The book is filled to the brim with little bits of linguistic knowledge that is sure to entertain fellow enthusiasts, but - and I hate to burst your bubble here - there’s more to it than good old fun with languages. In making the Royal Institute of Translation the foremost institution responsible for England’s imperial hegemony in her fictional world, Kuang is offering a strong, impossible-to-miss condemnation and indictment of the role academia played in the theories, structures and practices of Empire over here in the real world, too. This is not news, of course, but it’s not something academic institutions and society as a whole have fully reckoned with, either. Far from it, in fact.</p>

<p>Of course that’s not where the story ends. Robin will go places, meet people, see and experience things and it’s fun and exciting and scary and addictive and all that good stuff. Basically, the novel holds up as an adventure story really well, but the adventure is really just the groundwork. More important is that Robin throughout the novel’s events will be forced to reflect on his personal complicity in safeguarding this violent and suppressive system, which he has only been allowed to see the glitzy sides of because he could one day be useful to it. The book <em>is</em> a lot of fun to read, but it’s also asking the hard questions.</p>

<p>To resist or not to resist, and if to resist then how, and is the use of violence justified? And what does it even mean to win, and what comes after? <em>Babel</em> covers all of these puzzles and many more. There’s no easy answers, no clear-cut ones either; instead there’s plenty of anger and sadness and despair to go around, and at the end of the day what Robin and his friends are left with, what they can rely on most, is humanity. Not humanity as in the human race, nor as in the frankly naive concept of some inherent humanity we are all capable of (I mean, look at the state of our world right now). No, the humanity we can sometimes intuit in the eyes and hearts of the people closest to us, in the love we give and receive in return, in the kind acts of strangers. Humanity, compassion and true, deeply felt empathy. It’s not much to build a revolution on, but in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, if there’s any hope left, that’s where we’ll find it.</p>

<h2 id="alix-e-harrows-the-ten-thousand-doors-of-january">Alix E. Harrow’s <em>The Ten Thousand Doors of January</em></h2>

<p><img src="/docs/assets/images/doors.jpg" style="height: 300px; vertical-align: top; margin: 0.3em 1em 1em 0; float: left;" /></p>

<p>Going off the blurb of Alix E. Harrow’s <em>The Ten Thousand Doors of January</em>, I was expecting a colourful portal fantasy, an exciting romp through vibrantly painted worlds, with Seanan McGuire’s <em>Wayward Children</em> series as a better reference point than <em>Babel</em>. It became clear very quickly that I had been sorely mistaken. While categorising <em>The Ten Thousand Doors</em> as a portal fantasy is not wrong, per se, the world the book’s protagonists mainly travel to other worlds from is the one we spend most of our time in. There’s less jumping between universes than you’d expect; the novel does not luxuriate in imagining different worlds. Rather it is the <em>possibility</em> of traveling to places so different from our own <em>itself</em> that is the heart of the matter, the crux on which everything turns.</p>

<p>January Scaller is still a baby when she is taken in by business owner and prodigious collector Cornelius Locke. Her father Julian, her only parent, is largely absent; he is in Locke’s employ to unearth and bring back unusual archaeological objects wherever in the world he can find them. Locke takes up the responsibility for January’s upbringing himself instead. It is an unusually privileged existence for a non-white (red-skinned, as the book tells us) girl such as herself, but also an unhappy one. January desperately misses her father. A fanciful child who spends much of her days reading the adventure pulp magazines that the grocer’s boy secretely slips her, she feels hemmed in by Cornelius’ expectations of her.</p>

<p>At age seven she comes across a magical door in the middle of a field in Kentucky, of all places, which she discovers is a portal to another world. She tells Locke about it, and soon after the Door is destroyed, with January none the wiser of what it was or what happened to it. Locke becomes even more determined to curb her unruly behaviour after this event, however, taking strong measures to raise her into the model lady he wants her to be.</p>

<p>January acquiesces, at first: she tries to forget all about the Door and suppresses her innate sense of adventure. (The adventure pulps get a reprieve.) This resolve gets shattered when she finds a book entitled <em>The Ten Thousand Doors</em>, and it, too, talks of Doors. When she learns that she has a personal connection to the story in the book, and later on, that someone or something is racing to close the Doors and her father is wrapped up in the middle of it, the book’s plot’s off to the races. Just like in <em>Babel</em>, the plot works really well even when taken at face value. <em>The Ten Thousand Doors</em> offers mysteries, thrills and surprises to spare, and the novel’s pacing is just right, leaving enough space to get to know January in the first couple of chapters without dragging it out, before kicking things into higher gear. But, again, just like in <em>Babel</em>, however fun the adventure is - and it is a lot of fun - this is just one layer. <em>Doors</em>’ concerns run deeper.</p>

<p><em>Babel</em> puts academia and its role in the functioning of Empire at the center of its narrative. <em>The Ten Thousand Doors</em> does a similar thing with the archaeological societies of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These social clubs, consisting of rich white men who considered themselves to be experts in the field of archaeology, were not noble stalwarts of the pursuit of knowledge, no matter how much they liked to portray themselves as such. Societies such as <em>Doors</em>’ New England Archaeological Society engaged in the massive theft of cultural and artistic artifacts across the globe, justified their activities using the same racist underpinnings of Empire (they were ‘saving’ these artifacts from ‘savages’), and would gladly trade these artificats for the right price. The study of these objects was only a secondary goal if one at all. They were collecting trophies, to be put on display to impress people who looked, walked and talked just like them.</p>

<p><em>The Ten Thousand Doors of January</em> is a scathing critique of all of this, and this is still incredibly relevant today. Western museums, libraries, universities and other research institutions, not to mention private collectors, still possess swathes of objects obtained in this manner. In popular entertainment this practice is often presented as a hobbyist endeavour undertaken by noble treasure hunter leading men - <em>cough</em> Indiana Jones - but the reality was very different. These activities were excesses of Empire, their perpetrators co-conspirators who had every interest in throwing around their influence to ensure continued western global supremacy.</p>

<p>In revealing the New England Archaeological Society’s true purpose, Alix E. Harrow does not leave any part of this up to the imagination. The club’s theft of and trade in artifacts is just a front, a side hustle obscuring its main objective. What they’re really after is Doors. In Harrow’s fictional world, these magical portals to other worlds are what makes change possible, the thing that lets change flow into this world, literally. They therefore carry with them the power of imagination and creativity, but also the potential for upset, strife, revolution. This the Society fears, and so it strives to locate and destroy every last one of them. Without Doors, things remain how they are. Without Doors, the people in charge can rest easy, knowing they’ll still be in charge tomorrow. As metaphors go, it’s not subtle. But it works, it really does, which is down to Harrow’s wonderful writing.</p>

<p>Just like in <em>Babel</em>, the stakes are high, our heroes’ chances dire. One does not fight Empire and simply win; there is a definite cost to taking up this battle. But there is hope, even if it’s slim. Hope for real, meaningful change, as long as we are receptive to it, remain curious, welcoming and open-hearted, value difference. As long as we let these things be our guides.</p>

<h2 id="what-else-is-there">What else is there</h2>

<p><em>Babel, or the Necessity of Violence</em> and <em>The Ten Thousand Doors of January</em> have a lot in common. I feel justified in discussing them together on that basis, and I hope I didn’t do either an unjustice in doing so. Because the truth is, each of these books deserves to be put on a pedestal entirely their own; they are just that good. Just that poignant, relevant, original and intelligent, exhilirating, insightful, and moving.</p>

<p>Do they also tell us anything about <em>how</em> to resist Empire? Neither makes it look straight-foward or easy, that’s for sure. Neither is able to fully kill the beast in their alternate worlds, either. The struggle will be hard and long and violent. And yet there’s a sliver of hope.</p>

<p>Not because the chances of dismantling Empire in the course of any of our lifetimes are in our favour; it’s obvious they aren’t, not for Robin and January and not for us. But because there is value in living life by the values that will help us oppose it: kindness, compassion and love, curiosity and open-heartedness, community. I don’t know if these will be enough to see us through. But they’re something to hold onto. What else is there.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="2024 Reading Year in Review" /><category term="Books" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reading *The Ten Thousand Doors of January* by Alix E.
