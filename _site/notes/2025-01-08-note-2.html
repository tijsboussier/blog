        <p>The opening paragraphs might give the impression this essay by Ayşegül Savaş is nothing more than a piece of literary criticism focused on Donna Tartt’s <em>The Goldfinch</em>. Put it aside for that reason and you’d be making a mistake, however. Savaş uses her discomfort with the novel’s representation of Boris, the principal Russian character, as a jumping off point for a deeper exploration of how social justice discourse, despite and in contradiction of all its good intentions, favours certain groups of people over others. Liberal-minded people may no longer find it acceptable to present people of colour or LGBTQIA+ people in deeply stereotypical ways, for instance, but that same courtesy is not awarded Russian nationals, to name just one example. Why is that?</p>

<p>Confronting some of her friends with these thoughts, their reactions show Savaş that apparently, “<em>we have a limited potential for caring, […] we can only care about groups who are “innocent” in their history and political structure.</em>” Further on she formulates this as a question: “<em>is it alright to equate our disdain for a country’s politics — if that is at the heart of this — with its people?</em>”</p>

<p>Reading this, I couldn’t help but think of the anti-Israeli, anti-Jewish sentiment I see all around me currently, which all too often expands valid criticism of Israel’s politics and actions to a disdain and hatred of its entire population, or even of all Jewish people. I do not condone accusations of antisemitism when they’re used as a way to stifle legitimate criticism; there are definitely those who use them in that way. That does not mean, however, <em>all</em> accusations of antisemitism leveled at the pro-Palestinian movement fall under this category, as some seem to think. I’m disappointed, frankly, with the lack of willingness of certain groups in this movement to consider their statements with a higher degree of self-reflection and thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>Getting back to Savaş’ essay, it truly is a great piece of writing and there’s a lot I could and would like to quote, but this paragraph to my mind sums up the main point best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We might feel secure in our moral superiority, having adopted the latest politically correct language and attitudes. And yet, it is possible that we’ve set our sight only on a specific kind of experience while putting aside others, overlooking the same structures of thought that enforce exclusion. It is possible that political correctness, meant to protect human dignity, can become a rigid system of thought and lose sight of kindness as the compass with which we must orient ourselves in life and in art.</p>
</blockquote>
