## blog
I used to blog. Blogger, Wordpress, LiveJournal, Tumblr ...: you name it, [I was on it](spaces.md). For a long while now, though, I haven't been keeping that up and recently I've been missing it.

I still like to write, though, and sometimes I like to mess around with code (_mess around_, because I'm not proficient in any coding language). For a couple of years I've only been doing that behind closed doors. Now I'm starting publishing stuff online again. This is where I'll do that. 

This time around I'm doing it on my own domain and with a setup that includes Jekyll and Github, because I want to have control. Having my pages and posts as Markdown files I can always access, no matter what happens to the tools and website host I'm using at the moment, gives me ease of mind. And it allows me to be more playful and adventurous. This website is a constant work in progress.

There is no set topic or area of interest for this blog, really, though naturally I'll tend to write about the things I'm interested in.
