Hi there.

I'm Tijs. He/him, 39. Born and bred in Belgium, currently living in Brussels with a boyfriend and a cat.

I work as an EdTech policy advisor at KU Leuven's Faculty of Arts. 

During my downtime I read (predominantly SFF), watch TV and/or movies, or play ~~video games~~ CK3. I also spend a fair bit of time cooking - and am halfway decent at it, too - and studying languages; I'm currently taking night classes in Polish (conversation classes) and Swedish (first year). When I leave the house these days it's usually to go to the movies (my Cineville Pass is one of my most prized possessions), though I've also been known to enjoy the occasional bar or restaurant visit, the odd board game or two, or the sporadic trip aproad.

## About this website
I used to blog. Blogger, Wordpress, LiveJournal, Tumblr ...: you name it, I was on it. Then I stopped. It's been half a decade since I last published anything more substantial than an Instagram story. For just as long I've been missing it though and so, after a lot of soul-searching as well as a couple of previous, botched attempts, I'm now ready to put my stuff out there again.

I'm doing it a little bit differently this time around, on my own domain and with a set-up that puts everything firmly under my control. One reason for this is I don't want to be at the mercy of whichever corporation owns the platform I publish on. In addition, this set-up challenges me to really make this space my own. That's by design; I enjoy messing around with code and I want to do more of it. 

This website is my personal playground, to mess about with writing and web design. For right now, though, it really is just a dime-in-a-dozen blog.

My interests are manifold and I have a Pocket account full of saved articles to prove it, on topics that run the gamut from mathematics, physics, politics and history to celebrity profiles, business stories and so much more. That said, there are a few domains that interest me in particular: books (predominantly fiction, predominantly SFF), TV shows and films, languages, and technology. I expect I'll mainly be talking about things that fit those interests on here; that said, this website does not have a set range of topics, and nothing is off bounds.


## Credit
I'm building this website using Github and Jekyll. I set up the structure using [this Github Pages template](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) and I'm using [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) (the default Jekyll theme) as a jumping off point for the blog's structure, layout and styling, though I have made some minor tweaks and plan to make more. Thank you to the people maintaining the [instructions](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/README.md) on how to make those changes; they've been a great help.
