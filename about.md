## About me

I'm Tijs. He/him, 39. Born in Belgium, currently residing in Brussels. I work as an EdTech policy advisor at KU Leuven Faculty of Arts. But I'm not here to talk about work.

My interests are manifold. Jack of all trades, master of none? I guess, kind of, in that I have a Pocket full of saved articles that run the gamut from longreads on mathematics, physics, politics, medicine ... to celebrity profiles, business histories and so much more. I will never have the time to read them all. That said, there are a few domains that interest me in particular.

- Books! I like holding them, I like owning them and I like reading them. I mainly read fiction, a lot of so-called 'genre fiction' (SFF) with some other stuff thrown in between. It's not often I leave the house without my e-reader somewhere on me.

- Entertainment! I like watching TV (though I watch less of it than I used to) and films (which I'm watching more of as of very recently, check the (now-page)[now.md] for more on that). I play video games from time to time, too.

- Languages! My mother tongue is Dutch and my English is quite good, too. I'm also somewhat fluent in German, a bit less so in French and Polish, and I have recently started a bit of Swedish on Duolingo. I studied linguistics and literature at uni and while I focused my studies on literature and literary theory as much as I could at the time, my interest in linguistics has been on a steady trajectory upwards since.

- Technology! I've enjoyed using it/messing around with it since I was a teenager (software and the www rather than hardware). Everything I know about it and every skill I have with it was self-taught, though; not an expert, just an enthusiast.

## About this website
I used to blog. Blogger, Wordpress, LiveJournal, Tumblr ...: you name it, I was on it. Then I stopped. It's been half a decade since I last published anything more substantial than an Instagram story. For just as long I've been missing it though and so, after a lot of soul-searching as well as a couple of previous, botched attempts, I'm now ready to put my stuff out there again.

I'm doing it a little bit different this time around, on my own domain and with a set-up that puts everything firmly under my control. 

One reason for this is I really don't want to be at the mercy of whichever corporation owns the platform I publish on anymore. That is why the pages and posts on this website are Markdown notes in a folder I can always access, why the way the place looks and works is similarly stored in files I can freely edit. It will make moving this site to a different service if I ever need to easier than Wordpress, LiveJournal, Tumblr and the lot ever made it. That gives me ease of mind.

By the same token this set-up challenges myself to really make this space my own. That's by design, it excites me; I enjoy messing around with code and there will be opportunity to do that on here, too. Maybe I'll even get proficient at it. 

In short, I want to be adventurous, both in what and how I write and how I present it. This website is my personal playground.

That's enough waxing poetic about what right now, really, is just a blog, and a pretty basic one at that. It does not have a set topic or domain I want to cover here, though naturally I'll write about things I'm interested in.

## Credit
I'm building this website using Github and Jekyll. I set up the structure using [this Github Pages template](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). I selected the [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) (the default Jekyll theme) as a jumping off point for the blog's layout and styling, though I have made some minor changes and plan to make more. Thank you to the people maintaining the instructions on how to make those changes; they've been a great help.
