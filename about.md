## About this website
I used to blog. Blogger, Wordpress, LiveJournal, Tumblr ...: you name it, I was on it. Then I stopped. It's been half a decade since I last published anything more substantial than an Instagram story. I've been missing it for about as long.

I was still writing, however, and sometimes I messed around with code, too, but only behind closed doors. Now I want to start publishing stuff online again. Here is where I'll do that. 

I'm doing it a little bit different this time around, on my own domain and with a set-up that puts everything firmly under my control. It is a way to challenge myself to really carve out a space on the world wide web that is fully my own. In the same breath I also really don't want to be at the mercy of whichever corporation owns the platform I publish on anymore; I got burnt by that a few too many times. The pages and posts on this website are Markdown files in a folder I can always access; moving the blog to a different service if I ever need to will be easier than Wordpress, LiveJournal and Tumblr ever made it. That gives me ease of mind. 

It also allows me to be more adventurous. This website is my personal playground. It's a constant work in progress. 

That's enough waxing poetic about what right now, really, is just a blog, and a pretty messy one at that. It does not have a set topic or domain to cover, though naturally I'll tend to write about things I'm interested in.

## Credit
I'm building this website using Github and Jekyll. I set up the structure using [this Github Pages template](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). I selected the [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) (the default Jekyll theme) as a jumping off point for the blog's layout and styling, though I have made some minor changes and plan to make more. Thank you to the people maintaining the instructions on how to make those changes; they've been a great help.
