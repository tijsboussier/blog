## About this website
I used to blog. Blogger, Wordpress, LiveJournal, Tumblr ...: you name it, [I was on it](spaces.md). Then I stopped. It's been half a decade since I last published anything more substantial than an Instagram story and recently I find myself missing it.

I still liked writing during those years, however, and sometimes I would mess around with code, too, but only behind closed doors. Now I want to start publishing stuff online again. Here is where I'll do that. 

I'm doing it a little bit different this time around, on my own domain and with a set-up that puts everything firmly under my control. I don't want to be at the mercy of whichever corporation owns the publishing platform I use anymore. The pages and posts on this website are really just Markdown files in a folder I can always access, no matter what happens to the tools and website host I'm using to get those published on here. That gives me ease of mind. 

It also allows me to be more adventurous. This website is my personal playground, and it's a constant work in progress. For right now, it's a blog.

There is no set topic or area of interest for this blog, though naturally I'll tend to write about the things I'm interested in.

## Credit
I'm building this website using Github and Jekyll. I set up the structure using [this Github Pages template](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) and I've selected the [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) as a jumping off point for the blog's layout and styling (though I have made some minor changes and plan to make more). Thank you to the people keeping the instructions on how to make changes up to date; they've been a great help.
