I'm Tijs. 
- He/him. 40. Belgian. Brussels-based.  
- During office hours I'm an EdTech policy advisor at KU Leuven's Faculty of Arts. 
- In my downtime I read, watch TV and/or movies or play video games. I also enjoy messing around with tech, cooking and studying languages.
- Homebody. When I do leave the house it's usually to go to my Swedish night classes or to the movies, though I also enjoy bars/restaurants, hikes, board games and trips aproad.  
- Truly, I'm nothing special.

## About this website
I used to blog. Blogger, Wordpress, LiveJournal, Tumblr ... You name it, I was on it. Then I stopped.

In recent times I've been missing it though and so, after a lot of soul-searching, a bit of research as well as a couple of prematurely aborted attempts, I'm now ready to put my stuff out there again.

I'm doing it a little bit differently this time around. I don't want to be at the mercy of whichever corporation owns the platform I publish on anymore, so I've set this website up in a way that puts everything firmly under my control. This space is mine, a personal playground to mess around in with writing, web development and web design. For right now, though, it really is just a dime-in-a-dozen blog.

My interests are manifold. There are a few domains that interest me in particular - books (predominantly fiction), TV shows and films, languages, and technology - and I expect I'll mainly be talking about those on here. That said, this website does not have a set range of topics, and nothing is off bounds.


## Credit
I'm building this website using Github and Jekyll. I set up the structure using [this Github Pages template](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) and I'm using [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) (the default Jekyll theme) as a jumping off point for the blog's layout and styling, though I have made some minor tweaks and plan to make more. Thank you to the people maintaining the [instructions](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/README.md) on how to make those changes; they've been a great help.
