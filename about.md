## about this website
I used to blog. Blogger, Wordpress, LiveJournal, Tumblr ...: you name it, [I was on it](spaces.md). Then I stopped. It's been a minute since I last published anything more substantial than an Instagram story and recently I find myself missing it.

I still like to write, though, and sometimes I like to mess around with code (_mess around_, because I'm not proficient in any coding language). It's just that I've only been doing that behind closed doors in the past couple of years. Now I want to start publishing stuff online again. This is where I'll do that. 

This time around I'm doing it a little bit different, on my own domain and with a set-up that hands back full control to me. I don't want to be at the mercy of whichever corporation owns the publishing platform I use anymore. The pages and posts on this website are really just Markdown files in a folder I can always access, no matter what happens to the tools and website host I'm using to get those published on here. That gives me ease of mind. 

It also allows me to be more adventurous. This website is my personal playground, and it's a constant work in progress. For right now, it's a blog.

There is no set topic or area of interest for this blog, though naturally I'll tend to write about the things I'm interested in.

I'm building this website using Github and Jekyll. I set up the structure using [this Github Pages template](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) and I've selected the [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) as a jumping off point for the blog's layout and styling (though I have made some changes). Thank you to the people keeping the instructions on how to make changes to the theme up to date; they've been a great help.
