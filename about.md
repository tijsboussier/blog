## About this website
I used to blog. Blogger, Wordpress, LiveJournal, Tumblr ...: you name it, I was on it. Then I stopped. It's been half a decade since I last published anything more substantial than an Instagram story. For just as long I've been missing it though and so, after a lot of soul-searching as well as a couple of previous, botched attempts, I'm now ready to put my stuff out there again.

I'm doing it a little bit different this time around, on my own domain and with a set-up that puts everything firmly under my control. 

One reason for this is I really don't want to be at the mercy of whichever corporation owns the platform I publish on anymore. That is why the pages and posts on this website are Markdown notes in a folder I can always access, why the way the place looks and works is similarly stored in files I can freely edit. It will make moving this site to a different service if I ever need to easier than Wordpress, LiveJournal, Tumblr and the lot ever made it. That gives me ease of mind.

By the same token this set-up challenges myself to really make this space my own. That's by design, it excites me; I enjoy messing around with code and there will be opportunity to do that on here, too. Maybe I'll even get proficient at it. 

In short, I want to be adventurous, both in what and how I write and how I present it. This website is my personal playground.

That's enough waxing poetic about what right now, really, is just a blog, and a pretty basic one at that. It does not have a set topic or domain I want to cover here, though naturally I'll write about things I'm interested in.

## Credit
I'm building this website using Github and Jekyll. I set up the structure using [this Github Pages template](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). I selected the [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) (the default Jekyll theme) as a jumping off point for the blog's layout and styling, though I have made some minor changes and plan to make more. Thank you to the people maintaining the instructions on how to make those changes; they've been a great help.
