## About me

<img src="docs/assets/images/about.jpg" style="width: 25%; float: right; margin: 1em;" />

Hi, I'm Tijs. He/him, 39. Born in Belgium, currently living in Brussels. Working as an EdTech policy advisor at KU Leuven Faculty of Arts. But I'm not here to talk about work.

My interests are manifold. I have a Pocket full of saved articles on topics that run the gamut from mathematics, physics, politics and medicine to celebrity profiles, business histories and so much more. I will never have the time or stamina to read them all. That said, there are a few domains that interest me in particular.

- Books. Mainly fiction; I read a lot of genre fiction (SFF) with some other stuff thrown in between.  
- Entertainment. I like watching TV shows and films and can get quite intense about them at times. Sometimes I play video games, too.
- Languages. I studied them at uni and while I focused on literature and literary theory at the time, linguistics have developed into one of my great loves since. I'm a native Dutch speaker and I'm fluent in English; currently I'm brushing up on my French and German, learning Polish, and dabbling in Swedish.
- Technology. I enjoy using it/messing around with it (software, not hardware); everything I know about it and every skill I have in it I've taught myself.
- Social justice. On Tumblr I really got into social justice issues and that hasn't really gone anywhere since. I'm gay myself, so anything LGBTQIA+-related is of particular note to me.

I expect I'll mainly be talking about things that fit these interests on here, but I'm not ruling anything out. This website does not have a set topic or domain.

## About this website
I used to blog. Blogger, Wordpress, LiveJournal, Tumblr ...: you name it, I was on it. Then I stopped. It's been half a decade since I last published anything more substantial than an Instagram story. For just as long I've been missing it though and so, after a lot of soul-searching as well as a couple of previous, botched attempts, I'm now ready to put my stuff out there again.

I'm doing it a little bit differently this time around, on my own domain and with a set-up that puts everything firmly under my control. One reason for this is I really don't want to be at the mercy of whichever corporation owns the platform I publish on anymore. By the same token this set-up challenges me to really make this space my own. That's by design, it excites me. I enjoy messing around with code and there will be opportunity to do that on here, too. This website is my personal playground.

Right now, though, it really is just a dime-in-a-dozen blog.

## Credit
I'm building this website using Github and Jekyll. I set up the structure using [this Github Pages template](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) and I'm using [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) (the default Jekyll theme) as a jumping off point for the blog's layout and styling, though I have made some minor changes and plan to make more. Thank you to the people maintaining the [instructions](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/README.md) on how to make those changes; they've been a great help.
