Hi there. I'm Tijs.

#### the basics
- He/him
- 80s kid
- Born in Belgium
- Current homebase: Brussels
- Interests: books (mainly literature), film and TV, technology

#### work
I work as a policy advisor on educational technology at KU Leuven's Faculty of Arts. I coordinate and guide projects at the intersection of education and technology, I help teaching staff figure out how our various ed tech tools work and could be implemented in their classes and I organise and lead trainings. I also manage the university's LMS for the Faculty and do tech support.

But I'm not here to talk about work. 

#### personal project
I like to write, and I like to mess around with code. For a couple of years I've only been doing that behind lock and key. Now I'm thinking I want to publish some of it again. This is where I'll do that.

My private life will seep through everything I do on here.
