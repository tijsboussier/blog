## about this website
I used to blog. Blogger, Wordpress, LiveJournal, Tumblr ...: you name it, [I was on it](spaces.md). For a long while now, though, I haven't been keeping that up and recently I've been missing it.

I still like to write, though, and sometimes I like to mess around with code (_mess around_, because I'm not proficient in any coding language). For a couple of years I've only been doing that behind closed doors. Now I want to start publishing stuff online again. This is where I'll do that. 

This time around I'm doing it a little bit different, on my own domain and with a setup that includes Jekyll and Github. I don't want to be fully beholden to the commercial interests of whoever owns the publishing platform I use anymore; I want to have control. My pages and posts are Markdown files in a folder I can always access, no matter what happens to the tools and website host I'm going with at the moment and this gives me ease of mind. It also allows me to be more playful and adventurous.

This website is my personal playground, and it's a constant work in progress. For right now, it's mostly a blog.

There is no set topic or area of interest for this blog, though naturally I'll tend to write about the things I'm interested in.
