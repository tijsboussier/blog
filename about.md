## About this website
I used to blog. Blogger, Wordpress, LiveJournal, Tumblr ...: you name it, I was on it. Then I stopped. It's been half a decade since I last published anything more substantial than an Instagram story. For about as long I've been missing it though and so, after a lot of soul-searching and a couple of previous, botched attempts, I'm now ready to put my stuff out there again.

I'm doing it a little bit different this time around, on my own domain and with a set-up that puts everything firmly under my control. I really don't want to be at the mercy of whichever corporation owns the platform I publish on anymore. 

That's why the pages and posts on this website are Markdown notes in a folder I can always access, and why the way the place looks and works is similarly stored in files I can freely edit. It means moving this site to a different service if I ever need to will be easier than Wordpress, LiveJournal and Tumblr ever made it. That gives me ease of mind.

By the same token this set-up challenges myself to really carve out a space on the world wide web that is fully my own. That's by design; I enjoy messing around with coding and there will be space for that here, too. Maybe I'll even get proficient at it. 

In short, I want to be adventurous, both in what and how I write and how I present it. This website is my personal playground.

That's enough waxing poetic about what right now, really, is just a blog, and a pretty messy one at that. It does not have a set topic or domain to cover, though naturally I'll tend to write about things I'm interested in.

I'm building this website using Github and Jekyll. I set up the structure using [this Github Pages template](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). I selected the [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) (the default Jekyll theme) as a jumping off point for the blog's layout and styling, though I have made some minor changes and plan to make more. Thank you to the people maintaining the instructions on how to make those changes; they've been a great help.
