Hi there. I'm Tijs.

#### blog
I like to write and sometimes I like to mess around with code (_mess around_, because I'm not proficient in any coding language). For a couple of years I've only been doing that behind closed doors. Now I'm thinking I want to start publishing stuff online again. This is where I'll do that.
