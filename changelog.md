#### 5 December 2024
- Added a different style for buttons.
- Defined a separate style for the piece of introductory text I add to posts that are part of a series. This allowed me to get rid of horizontal rules completely.

#### 4 December 2024
- Added the Now page.
- Style template I used for this website had the title of the pages that the navbar has links to set up as the name for the links themselves. I did not like that, so I figured out a system to separate page title from link name.
- Fun with fonts! Read up on web fonts, at least until I knew enough to implement them on this website. Now using Source Serif 4 for headings.
- Using horizontal rules <code><hr></code> in some places, really just as placeholders while I develop this website's layout and styling, and they do not look good. Replaced them now in one place where I was using them, at the top of the tag section on blog posts. A simple 1px solid border already looks much nicer.

#### 1 December 2024
- Made the header sticky and non-transparent.

#### 30 November 2024
- Set up a local test environment for this website, so I won't have to run tests in production anymore.

#### 29 November 2024
- Added an icon for [The Storygraph](https://www.thestorygraph.com/) in the footer. The Storygraph is not part of the standard set of platforms Minima has a social media icon for, so I converted the service's logo into an SVG file, edited it to make sure it had the right size and color to fit the rest of the icons, then implemented it.

#### 28 November 2024
- Set up a basic tagging system.
- Figured out how to change the theme's SASS variables and added custom styles to get font-family, font-weight and text-align where I wanted them to be.
- Created this changelog.

#### 27 November 2024
- Launched the website. In truth it had already been live for a few days for testing purposes (I did not have a local test environment set up yet), but on 27 November I published my first post and shared that news on Instagram.
