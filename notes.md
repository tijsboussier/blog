<p class="infobox">I read a lot online. Here I collect some of the best writing I come across, with some notes of my own. The inspiration for this definitely came from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/" target="_blank">Simon Willison's linkblog</a>, though what I'm doing here is not an exact copy of it. I've set up <a href="https://tijsboussier.eu/feed/notes.xml" target="_blank">a separate feed</a> for these, if anyone's interested.</p>
