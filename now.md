## Current focuses
- I've been a proud holder of a <a href="https://cinevillepass.be/en-BE" target="_blank">Cineville Pass</a> for only a few weeks, but since I've had it I've been to the cinema weekly, seeing movies I probably wouldn't have gone to see in cinema (or seen at all) if I had had to pay for a regular ticket. It's been a blast.
- My boyfriend gave me a <a href="https://play.date/" target="_blank">Playdate</a> for my birthday. It's honestly such a nifty little gaming device, perfect for a casual gamer like myself, and it just looks so pretty. My favourite game to play on it so far is <a href="https://play.date/games/summit/" target="_blank">Summit</a>.

## This month
#### Activities
- The Belgian national team got booted out off the UEFA European Football Championship by France. I saw the game with friends, in a brown bar in Hasselt, which is a great way to do it. As for the Championship in general, I tried to get into the spirit of the thing this year, but in the end that only half worked; I only saw two out of the four games Belgium played and I don't feel any regrets about that whatsoever.
