This is my <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">Now-page</a>, inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a>. Last updated on {{ page.date | date: '%e %B %Y' }}. Archive <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/then">here</a>.

## Projects

- **Language study**. I'm currently taking night classes in Polish (conversation classes) and Swedish (language course). I'm also using Anki and Duolingo for extra practice for both, as well as for French and German revision.
- **This blog**. After years of talking about it, I have finally gone and done it. I've been loving writing and posting, as well as tinkering with how this place looks. I'm keeping track of changes that have to do with layout, style and structure [here]({{site.baseurl}}/changelog).
