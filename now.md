This is my <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">Now-page</a>, inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a>. Last updated on {{ page.date | date: '%e %B %Y' }}. Archive <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/then">here</a>.

## Projects

- **Language study**. I'm currently taking night classes in Polish (conversation classes) and Swedish (language course). I'm also using Anki and Duolingo for extra practice for both, as well as for French and German revision.
- **This blog**. After years of talking about it, I have finally gone and done it. I've been loving writing and posting, as well as tinkering with how this place looks. I'm keeping track of changes that have to do with layout, style and structure [here]({{site.baseurl}}/changelog).

## Odds and ends
- I spent the last week and a half of December with family. First my mother, my sisters and their families, my boyfriend and I stayed a few days somewhere close to Breda, then my boyfriend and I left a day early to go to Wolfsburg, Germany, of all places, to be with his family for a few days. (Note to future self: Wolfsburg is not a city anyone should want to visit, though the Kunstmuseum was nice.) Holidays were celebrated, gifts exchanged, food shared, good times had. Maybe a cleanse is appropriate now, after the copious amounts of food I consumed.
