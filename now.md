## What I'm doing now

- **Going to the movies**. Since I got my <a href="https://cinevillepass.be/en-BE" target="_blank">Cineville Pass</a> in the second half of June  I've been to the cinema every week, seeing movies I probably wouldn't have gone to see in cinema (or seen at all) if I had had to pay for a regular ticket. It's been a blast.
- **Checking out my <a href="https://play.date/" target="_blank">Playdate</a>**. Birthday gift from my boyfriend. It's honestly such a nifty little gaming device, perfect for a casual gamer such as myself who appreciates when a game is not just fun to play, but also looks aesthetically pleasing. Favourite games so far are <a href="https://play.date/games/crankin/" target="_blank">Crankin's Time Travel Adventure</a>, <a href="https://play.date/games/mars-after-midnight/" target="_blank">Mars After Midnight</a> and <a href="https://play.date/games/summit/" target="_blank">Summit</a>,
- **Starting a blog**. You're on it. More about that [here](/about.md).
