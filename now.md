This is my [Now-page](https://nownownow.com/about). Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/). Last updated on {{ page.date | date: '%e %B %Y' }}

## Projects

- **Language study**. I'm currently taking night classes in Polish (conversation classes) and Swedish (language course). I'm also using Anki and Duolingo for extra practice for both, as well as for French and German revision.
- **This blog**. After years of talking about it, I have finally gone and done it. I've been loving writing and posting, as well as tinkering with how this place looks. I'm keeping track of changes that have to do with layout, style and structure [here]({{site.baseurl}}/changelog).

## Odds and ends
- In June I got myself a Cin√©ville Pass, which for a fixed monthly fee lets me to go to the movies at the participating cinemas as often as I like. In Brussels this includes all of the independent ones. I continue to make good use of my membership also now that the honeymoon period has waned. Not only have I seen more movies in 2024 than I have in years, I'm also checking out movies I would never have otherwise. I feel really good about this.
