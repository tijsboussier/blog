## Projects

- **Language study**. I'm currently taking night classes in Polish (conversation classes) and Swedish (language course). I'm also using Anki and Duolingo for extra practice for both, as well as for French and German revision.
- **This blog**. After years of talking about it, I have finally gone and done it. I've been loving writing and posting, as well as tinkering with how this place looks. I'm keeping track of changes that have to do with layout, style and structure [here]({{site.baseurl}}/changelog).

## Odds and ends
- I spent the last week and a half of December with family. First my mother, my sisters and their families, my boyfriend and I stayed a few days in a vacation home close to Breda, then my boyfriend and I travelled to Wolfsburg, Germany to be with his family for half a week. (Note to future self: Wolfsburg is not a city you'd want to visit again, though the Kunstmuseum was nice.) Holidays were celebrated, gifts handed over, wishes exchanged, copious amounts of food consumed, and good times had.
