## What I'm doing now

- **Going to the movies**. Since I got my <a href="https://cinevillepass.be/en-BE" target="_blank">Cineville Pass</a> in the second half of June  I've been to the cinema pretty much every week, seeing movies I probably wouldn't have gone to see in cinema (or seen at all) if I had had to pay for a regular ticket. It's been a blast.
- **Starting a blog**. You're on it. More about that [here](/about.md).
