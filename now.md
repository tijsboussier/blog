Now-page inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff">Derek Sivers</a>. July edition.

#### current focuses
- I am now a proud holder of a <a href="https://cinevillepass.be/en-BE" target="_blank">Cineville Pass</a>. Since I have it, I've started going to the cinema weekly, seeing movies I probably wouldn't have gone to see in cinema if I had to pay for a regular ticket, and it's been a blast.
- My boyfriend gave me a <a href="https://play.date/" target="_blank">Playdate</a> for my birthday. It's honestly such a nifty little gaming device, perfect for a casual gamer like myself, and it just looks so aesthetically pleasing. My favourite game to play on it so far is <a href="https://play.date/games/summit/" target="_blank">Summit</a>.
