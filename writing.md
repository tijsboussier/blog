# Writing journey

As far as I can remember I've always enjoyed writing. As a kid I wrote stories, journals (many started, none finished), a comic book that I made the drawings for myself ... Essays were my favourite school assignments. I must have been somewhat good at it, too. My report on a spelunking expedition we undertook in fifth grade, which I approached in a tongue-in-cheek way by summarising the various reasons I had hated it, *killed* when I was asked to read it aloud in class.

Back then when people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I told them I wanted to be a writer. If that didn't pan out, I would train to be either the king's chef or his chief violinist. (Every king needs one, natch.) I let that dream go by the time I was at secondary school, though I did keep up writing, made somewhat easier by the fact that my family now owned a computer. 

I loved it. I took to it immediately, to play games, to go through the content on some educational CD-ROMs we had or to do homework, standard stuff, but I was also messing around with a fractals generator my father had installed in DOS and creating stuff with a piece of audio and video editing software that had come with the device. I don't know what I used Notepad for, but I remember I opened it, a lot. I would also randomly change the computer's settings multiple times over, angering my father in the process. I just wanted to try it all out.  After some time I knew the device better than anybody else in the house.

One of the files on that computer that was mine was a Word doc with story ideas. I'd also store drafts of some of the stories themselves. I made a cover page for them, then printed them out using the expensive color ink for it. I think about a third of the time I spent on our computer was spent writing in some way or other. As I got older, I gradually moved away from stories and would only write fiction to enter the annual writing competition my teachers wanted me to enter. But I was still writing, and looking for an outlet.

The very first writing-for-the-web project I undertook was a website about the country of Uganda. I was a prepubescent teen then, a weird and awkward kid with some unusaul interests and I'd become fascinated by the country after reading a [comic book](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_dorpstiran_van_Boeloe_Boeloe) set in a fictional nation that was based on it. I did my own research - my father's full set of the Winkler Prins encyclopedia proved essential in this endeavour - and wrote up summaries of the country's history, geography, nature ... with the ambition of publishing it online at some point. Inspired by fan-made GeoCities websites I'd seen, I tried to imitate them as best I could with limited resources. I used a little program on our home computer to lay-out the pages and create hyperlinks between them, as well as fashion a little menu to tie the whole website together.

The problem was our home computer was not tied into any network at the time. I had to take my bike to the local library every time I wanted to get on the internet, access to which was doled out in half-hour blocks only. The use of CD-ROMs and USB sticks to transfer over files was strictly prohibited. So my little passion project lived on our home computer only, never to see its day in the sun.

As it stood, it would take a couple more years until anything I wrote actually made its way to the web. That was at university, where I started to blog, first on Blogger, then Wordpress and eventually LiveJournal. The first two I had trouble motivating myself to maintain; I wanted them to be great, well-written and -researched, but at the same time felt deeply insecure about anything I produced. It was on LJ, something in between a blogging platform and a social network, that I found my niche. 

I had a lot of fun writing on LJ. My posts would range from typical blog content to obsessing over fandom to more personal, journalistic writing. There were book reviews, movie reviews and TV recaps, thoughts and opinions on things like politics and LGBTQI+ issues, but just as often I would describe the minutiae that make up the bulk of my life. I did all of this without (too much) fear of being called out for not being enough of an expert to have a say on any of it. I was proud of some of what I produced, and I definitely tried to do it well, but hindsight is 20/20: the real joy I had in doing it came from just being creative, getting stuff out there, stuff that I liked and had enjoyed getting down, and not caring too much about what people's opinions might be. I learned to leave well enough alone.

Then a Russian company bought LiveJournal and made some unpopular changes. People started to leave and I followed them over to Tumblr, which then was the new kid on the block. I was a keen reblogger on there, but my original output dwindled. I kept my Tumblr blog up for a couple of years, until I accidentally locked myself out of my account - a mishap with multi-factor authentication - and Tumblr refused to believe I was, in fact, still me.[^1]

So that was that. I didn't stop writing exactly, but the little of it I have done since has been very intermittent - as it was already in my Tumblr days - and saved only as personal notes. Almost as soon I stopped I was thinking about getting back into it, into the habit of publishing some of what I write online. A desire for perfection and professionalism held me back. I came up with ambitious plans, created long todo lists for them stopping only short of a Gantt chart, meanwhile never got beyond writing the about-section and failing to even deliver a version of that that I considered worthy. I left things as they were, not knowing how to get out of that rut. 

But the desire, the urge never left me. So this is me, trying yet again.
